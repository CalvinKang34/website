* Mistake in elections schedule bullet point - formatting glitch
* Minutes were approved

### Genomics workshop updates (Aida and Cory)
* 2 calls sent out for helpers and instructors
* We are well prepared - the workshop next week is a new one we are holding, mostly in R
* More helpers are needed, these sign-ups needed by Thursday/Friday
* Don't have to be an expert in the field to be a helper, just need to review and understand lesson

### IFAS reports (Cory)
* 

### Budget documents & amounts (Audrey and Ike)
* Ike sent the updated budget to Audrey
* Audrey shared her screen and we reviewed the budget
* 2 current accounts: 2024 Data Carpentries Budget and 2024 Workshop Budget, total available is $939.39 - possibly have one instructor training
* To see where money is coming from, look at FY23 tab and this shows breakdown of money sources/sponsors
* The budget can be organized to have one table with internal revenue and cost and another table with sponsorships, membership costs, and instructor training costs
