- Still have not heard back from UFGI - Vijay will follow up.

- Perhaps we include a 'respond by' date in our sponsorship emails to motivate responses
    - Request response by end of February


### **Annual Report**
- Send out an annual report to our sponsors (hasn't been done lately)
    - Need to clarify when the report should be sent out
- Need to update master list of workshop partcipants
- Will return to next meeting
### **Debrief: Spring 2021 Intro to R Workshop** 
- Workshop polling improved as workshop went on
    - People initially thought we moved too quickly, but as workshop progressed they thought it was just the right pace
        - We adjusted pace some, and participants got more comfortable with R/slack/etc. over course of workshop
        - Positive feedback regarding use of Slack
- Vijay: Great first experience teaching and organizing workshop, pacing of 2nd day was better than first
- Narayani: Teaching and organizing was very good learning experience, noted that many people indicated the pacing was too fast
    - Too many data structures to cover all in one session
- Neeka: Really positive experience, willing to help with future workshops
- Fewer people attended 2nd day than first
    - ~32 participants first day
    - ~25 participants second day 
        - Dropped down as low as ~20 by end of 2nd day
- Not everyone responded to confirmation email within specified deadline, so spots were given to others on the waitlist
    - Some people who lost their spot due to lack of response subsequently sent angry email about losing spot
- Organization of workshop felt a bit rushed - especially recruitment of instructors/helpers
- Given number of helpers, we could have handled more participants without being overwhelmed by questions
    - Perhaps bump registration limit to 40 or 45 participants
- Could we make workshop signup for each day independent?
    - Register for first day, separately register for 2nd
    - May make keeping track of workshop registrations difficult
- We can request participants not share the Zoom link with others for future workshops
    - Prevents non-registered parties from attending (and prevents Zoom-bombing) 

### **Future Workshops**
- Instructor training
    - We have 6 slots allocated for virtual instructor training
        - Can choose to sponsor additional participants, but its pricey ($1000+ per added participant)
- Tentatively target end of March for next workshop
    - Geospatial?
- Should we run another Intro to R workshop again?
    - 7-8 people who did not attend most recent workshop indicated desire to attend
- Run a Genomics workshop in early May?
    - Want to avoid late April since that's finals period and semester wrap-up
    - Target break between Spring and Summer semesters - this is when people are likely available
    - Need to make sure we have the instructional expertise to run this one

### **Next Meeting**
- Ideas for next workshop
- Annual report discussion with Geraldine
- Budget discussion

### **Info for Next Meeting**
- Next meeting: Feb 16th, 2021 10:00 AM (ET)
