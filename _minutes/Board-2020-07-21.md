## Notes

### Introductions
- Brian, Alethea, Elise, Carla, Eve

### Approve minutes from June 16, 2020 board meeting
- Approved

### REC Workshop debrief
- Circulated initial invite to REC folks (10-11 people) then opened up to UFII listerve (filled, then 15 people added to waitlist)
  - Half of people that registered showed up to workshop (15 people), should we charge a fee to make sure people show up
  - Not a lot of extra work to have a higher registration limit
- Four day format: all day long is a long time for zoom, so shorter segments were appreciated
  - People who came for the first day generally stayed the whole time
- Alethea has found that a fee of $10 has helped with other workshops
  - If you deliberately contact people at the beginning of the workshop to confirm that they're planning to attend, could also improve turnout
  - long term, for digital workshops: have to think of financial solvency as well
- for the people who registered but did not attend, will we take any action, like choosing to not let them register for another workshop, lower priority on the student list
  - Didn't take attendance this time, but consider for future workshops
  - Has been effective in other Carpentries workshops
- Thought it went really well
- Slack channel really helped
- What do we do for more advanced workshops when beginners are in attendance?
  - Make sure it's clear in the original write up
  - How do we screen this?
  - Carpentries used to have pre-screening questions, but people have trouble evaluating themselves 
  - Send people the beginning material to people telling them what we will be skipping
  - Don't have to ask them to leave, but just state that their questions are related to basic material, and instructors/helpers can't spend time on it
- Some feedback that the REC people preferred the virtual, flexible to join in/leave as needed


### Develop best practices procedures for security and safety of virtual workshops
- Want to formally address this
- How do we handle registrations
- Waiting room feature
- if meant for ufl people, people should register with their ufl email
  - Have moderators who should only allow for people on the list
  - Don't allow non-ufl people to not register
  - When we set up the meeting, we can set up this filter
- If we do decide with a nominal fee model, then having two registration options
  - zoom has a registration required option
  - Also need DOCE registration if collecting fee
- Tell people to register with ufl account, but if they cannot, then workshop coordinator should verify
- we could use zooms' automatic registration: 
	- we can review and approve their registration
	- we can have zoom automatically approve them, but the link is unique to that user
	- does restrict the zoom browser, can't use the web client
	- Brian ran a workshop on this, had 100 participants, no issues
	- allows you to know exactly who is attending the workshop, and allows you to disable the link
- make the moderator also the code of conduct faciliator, to ensure that theres nothing odd
- For now, make ufl email manditory, but what about non-ufl workshop attendees?
	- case by case basis, bring to the board
- if registration is run through DOCE, Alethea and Flora will separate out non-ufl emails
- Elise will email UF carpentries code of conduct board for now to see if they have guidelines

### Carpentries membership renewal
- gold membership
	- $15k per year, includes in person instructor training as well as 6 online instructor trainings
- silver membership
	- $7,500 per year, no in person training, but 6 online instructor training
- Training records (capacity 24)
- 2018, <= 19 people
- 2019, <= 17 people
- Have we hit saturation with the number of instructors that we're training?
- In person instructor training costs: 
	- $100/night*4 nights= $400
	- $750 airfare * 2 instructros = $1500
- $9400 saved if we don't do the gold level ($25-50/person)
	- about $750-900 per workshop (30 people, Alethea confirmed)
	- With $9400, could subsidize full expenses for 10-12 workshops, half expenses for 20-25 workshops (assuming in person workshops)
- Could we alternate gold membership every other year, then each year, we could: offer free or reduced workshop costs, more equitable access to our workshops, more direct benefits to sponsors (money helps directly fund workshops for students/staff
- Disadvantages: less money to the Carpentries, reduced access to instructor training
- Big unknown, don't know if we will be able to have an in person instructor workshop
- Some departments have had budget cuts, may be unlikely to supply similar funding in the future, university may have budget cuts
- If we used IFAS funds for silver, then 3k would be remaining, would be useable for workshops, but with remaining funds, IFAS will not carry forward beyond this fiscal year
	- could address this closer to the date
- Going for silver this year? we put to vote, unanimous decision to go for only silver membership this year

### Next meeting agenda item
- will resume discussion next Tuesday at 2:30
- August workshops and other item tabled
- for the next meeting: add agenda item for how we approach sponsors this year
