## Notes

### Elections
- 8 applicants
- Do we want to waive the criteria for outreach coordinator?
- Is the listserve the best way to reach out to people?
- Next year, forward to sponsoring departments
- Informatics-teaching does encompass people who have attended a list
- Mel Moreno (WEC), could be a good candidate: scientific support 
- Could we have incentives for board members and/or a full time staff that helps, get it included in people's job descriptions
    - How do we get people to sign up to lead workshops?
    - Foster community a bit more; social events
    - Announce elections after each workshop
- What if we do the social in a week or two? 
    - Spread the word a bit earlier next year
    - Is Greg sending out announcements on grad student listserve? (elections weren't announced on this listserve)
    - encourage people to attend the board meetings
    - Plan to organize a social to:
        - Meet the new board
        - lunch hour with pizza
        - turn it into a town hall
    - pushing it back twice looks bad, also a fairness issue; people who got it in put the time in
    - original was 7, had a tie, had 8, then lost 2
    - Not a big deal if we just go ahead and elect everyone that applied
    - In agreement: take all the applicants for the new board (have elections)
        - Next meeting: before board meeting on 9/24, have pizza, invite funders to the social, push board meeting earlier
        - set time at 12pm-1:30 lunch with meeting to follow
        - Elections close on the day of the social
        - Include mention of travel awards at the social
        - Advertise social through R-Ladies
            - Twitter and meetup
    - How many people instructed in the last year (about 20), if we have food for 30-40...have 42 instructors (alhtough there might be duplicates)
- Social in spring for a month before instructor training

### Travel awards
- scored awards
- have enough for 3 awards ($1500)
- the call was for $500
- All agreed to award all three
- De-anonymized process worked well (double-blind)

    - developed all materials, was a lot of different people
    - wasn't super well aligned
    - went well, people from USDA and Demitri are interested in doing it again
    - sort of uneven, some of the sessons went better than others, people need to coordinate lessons a bit better
