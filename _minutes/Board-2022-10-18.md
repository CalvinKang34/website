          -**Flat base workshop fee tiered by role at UF; lunch fee not teired
          -**Utilize nametags with lunch/no lunch marker
     - Hoda: Thought the $10 fee for workshop with 2 days & 2 lunches was a good deal
          -**Maybe combine 2 of the ideas: have a flat fee (tiered) & option for lunch added fee (not tiered) 
     - Dellena: Tiered flat fee based on role at UF
     - Cory: there was substantial interest in Genomics workshop. Do we want to have 2 Genomic workshops per year (Fall & Spring)
