## Notes
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->

### Introductions

Everyone present knew everyone else, so we skipped introductions.

### Approval of previous meeting minutes

**Audrey** will reach out to CJ for possible paper or un-pushed minutes from the May 2 meeting.

### Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists workshop, September 7–8

**Cory** will contact Ke and Vaasuki about meeting later this week to prepare for the workshop next week.

For future reference, Flora can also send relevant announcements to the Artificial Intelligence listserv. (Not this workshop.)

### Meet-and-greet, September 13

**Cory** and **Dellena** will meet after this meeting to plan the event and send an update to the Board.

**Audrey** will locate the PowerPoint slides used at previous meet-and-greets on the Google Drive.

**Flora** will prepare a sign-up form for the meet-and-greet.

### Instructor trainings

We have roughly $400 remaining from previous workshops. This will be used to cover food at the meet-and-greet.

We (may) have roughly $3000 remaining from sponsorships. This will be used to support instructor trainings.

**Audrey** will request Ike to join the next Board Meeting to discuss budget formats.

**Audrey** will determine the membership renewal date.

### Genomics workshop, October 2–3

**Cory** and **Aida** will meet later today to plan this workshop.

We will be using a different lesson for this workshop ([Intro to R and RStudio for Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/)), which (per Natya) is less intesive regarding command line file navigation and uses Bioconductor for many tasks.

### IFAS reports

We need to restart these reports, which stopped a couple of years ago.

We will prioritize this discussion in the meeting with Ike.

### Workshop photographs

Flora noted that we should include a request for permission to take photos in the registration process.

**Flora** will incorporate this into the meet-and-greet sign-up form.

### Any other business

Audrey noted that sponsorship requests should be added to the next meeting agenda.

Audrey noted that elections should be added to the next meeting agenda.

### Next board meeting

**Cory** will email the board to decide whether to schedule the next Board Meeting for next week or the following.

**Cory** will chair the next meeting, and **Audrey** will secretary.
