## Events

Events are things that people can attend. They will have a time and location and
a planned schedule. A workshop, meet-up, rez-baz are events. Things like 
elections and calls for proposals are not events and should be under news only.

To add a new event:

1. Create a new file in the `/_events` directory. Use the date as the first part
of the file name and the rest should be the lower-cased "slug" if it is a
Carpentries workshop or some other meaningfull abbreviation if it is something
else.
1. The file should contain YAML front matter. See an existing file for the 
variables to set. 
1. The remainder of the file can be empty if the `website` variable is set to an
outside site or it can be a description of the event if there is no outside 
site.
1. If the `website` points to the event page on this site, it should be of the
form `/events/<file name with no extenstion>/`
1. The start data controlls order on the page. The end date controls "upcoming"
or not.
