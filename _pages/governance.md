## Club Charter

The [club charter](https://uf-carpentry.github.io/website/charter/) describes the goals of our organization, the executive Board for the club, and our procedures for making decisions.

## Board Meeting Minutes

Meetings of the board are open to the UF community. We also keep minutes of our meetings to help make decision-making transparent. Please see the [minutes page]({{site.url}}/minutes/) for links to the minutes from each board meeting.

## Financial Awards

The fees from our workshops go towards supporting club activities and also as travel awards for instructors. Please see our [award policies](https://uf-carpentry.github.io/website/awards/) for more information.
