Our main activity is teaching [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) workshops. 

The cost for these 2-day workshops is $46 (as of 2018), of which about $30 goes towards food and drink (lunch and breaks). The rest is used for organizational logistics and the occasional [travel award]({{ site.baseurl }}/awards/). Our instructors, workshop members, and board all serve on a volunteer basis.

Most workshops use lesson materials from the Carpentries. These are designed to
provide novice users with a foundation to continue learning on their own,
with their peers, or more formally in coursework. As part of the UF community, 
we also strive to connect our learners with other opportunites for learning 
programming and data analysis on campus.

We typically teach one to three workshops per semester and registration is 
usuallly announced on the UFII mailing list and the UF graduate student mailing
list. You can also monitor our site here or join our [list serve](https://lists.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=INFORMATICS-TEACHING-L)

## Venue

The UF [Informatics Institute](https://informatics.institute.ufl.edu/) and 
[Biodiversity Institute](https://biodiversity.institute.ufl.edu/) share a 
multi-function space on the main floor of the CISE building facing the Marston 
Science Library and Century Tower. They generously allow us to use their 
classroom and meeting facilities as well as provide the staff for catering and
logistical support.
