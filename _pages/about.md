## About Us
Our main activity is teaching [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) workshops. You can find information about the Club and our work on this wiki. A good place to start is [our charter]({{ site.baseurl }}/charter/).

## Mission Statement
The UF Carpentries Club is a group of independent members of the UF community dedicated to providing structured pathways for our colleagues to learn informatics skills outside of the traditional university curriculum. The Club is open to any member of the UF community including staff, faculty, and students, paid, and volunteer. We follow the [Carpentries’ Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) to provide an inclusive and supportive environment for our learners and our members. In addition to our core informatics goal, we seek to bring the Carpentries’ teaching methods to instructors and to develop a research community dedicated to open and reproducible science.
