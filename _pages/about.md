## Mission Statement

The UF Carpentries Club is a group of independent members of the UF community dedicated to providing structured pathways for our colleagues to learn informatics skills outside of the traditional university curriculum. The Club is open to any member of the UF community including staff, faculty, and students, paid, and volunteer. In addition to our core informatics goal, we seek to bring the Carpentriesâ€™ teaching methods to instructors and to develop a research community dedicated to open and reproducible science.
