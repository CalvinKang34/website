Our main activity is teaching [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) workshops. 

The cost for these 2-day workshops is currently $46 (as of 2018), of which about $30 goes towards food and drink (lunch and breaks). The rest is used for organizational logistics and the occasional [travel award]({{ site.baseurl }}/awards/). Our instructors, workshop members, and board all serve on a volunteer basis.

A good place to find more detailed info is [our charter]({{ site.baseurl }}/charter/).

## Mission Statement

The UF Carpentries Club is a group of independent members of the UF community dedicated to providing structured pathways for our colleagues to learn informatics skills outside of the traditional university curriculum. The Club is open to any member of the UF community including staff, faculty, and students, paid, and volunteer. We follow the [Carpentries’ Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) to provide an inclusive and supportive environment for our learners and our members. In addition to our core informatics goal, we seek to bring the Carpentries’ teaching methods to instructors and to develop a research community dedicated to open and reproducible science.
