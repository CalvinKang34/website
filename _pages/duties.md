The Board is encouraged to be flexible and responsive in its delegation of responsibilities, as outline in the [charter]({{ site-baseurl }}/charter/). This page provides specific guidance for regular duties.

## Board Meeting agendas and minutes

As soon as feasible following each Board Meeting:

* The **Secretary** publishes their minutes at the [minutes page]({{ site.baseurl }}/minutes/) and closes the issue at the [coordination repo issues page](https://github.com/UF-Carpentry/Coordination/issues) for the concluded meeting.
* The **Chair-elect** creates an issue at the [coordination repo issues page](https://github.com/UF-Carpentry/Coordination/issues) with the date, time, and agenda for the next meeting.
* The **Chair-elect** or **Secretary-elect** publishes an entry on the [events page]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/) for the next meeting.
