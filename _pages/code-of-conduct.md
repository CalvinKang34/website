The UF Carpentries Club exists to foster a community for inclusive learning and teaching of informatics skills. Thus, we are committed to creating a welcoming, supportive, safe, and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of background or identity. This code of conduct helps us in this objective.

This document supplements the Carpentries [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html), which also applies to our workshops.

## Philosophy

The UF Carpentries Club believes that learning is best achieved in a positive and supportive environment. As such, **we do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or any behavior that excludes or causes discomfort to others.**

We recognize that individuals and groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination. It is the responsibility of everyone who participates in our events to respect and be mindful of these characteristics that have been the basis of harassment or discrimination. Such characteristics include, but are not limited to: gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, medical and familial status, veteran status, religion or belief (or lack thereof), age, education, socio-economic status, and experience level. Again, **we do not tolerate harassment on the basis of these categories, or in any form.**

## Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform, whether online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment, we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all Carpentries events and platforms:

* use welcoming and inclusive language that is appropriate for a diverse audience
* be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* act in good faith and assume that others do as well: e.g. gracefully accept constructive criticism
* give everyone a chance to talk and contribute to activities and discussions
* humor is appreciated; however, sexual, racist, or exclusionary jokes and imagery are never appropriate
* recognize that intentions do not equal impact; be ready to apologize or correct yourself when this occurs

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
* insults or put downs
* sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
* sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
* continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
* the display of sexual or violent images
* publication of private communication without consent
* unwelcome sexual attention
* nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
* causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
* violent threats or language directed against another person
* incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm

## Enforcement

Community members and workshop participants who are asked to stop any harassing or discriminatory behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to all of our workshops and events, as well as interactions that take place online, across e-mail, Etherpad, social media or in any other medium.

If someone engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, they may be warned, asked to leave the event or premises, or reported to other organizations for further investigation and sanctions (including, but not limited to The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee, the University of Florida, or law enforcement). 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns, please let us know through one or more of these reporting options:

**(Do note that some of contacts may be UF employees who are mandatory reporters. If you have concerns about privacy or escalation of certain incidents, you may wish to use the anonymous form or check with the instructor or organizer of the event before reporting.)**
