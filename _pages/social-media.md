## Who runs this?

Members of the [UF Carpentries Club board]({{site.baseurl}}/governance) serve as administrators on these social media websites. We use [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) to share access to our Twitter account. Currently, Hao and Gaurav have access to our Twitter account.

## How do we run it?

Content shared on our social media websites should follow the guidelines and code of conduct below. These are based on the policies of [R-Ladies Social Media Guide](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/blob/9b7caa0e55789a2b416a3b8041ee5ea7fb8055d9/Social_Media_Guide_for_Chapters.pdf).

### Do promote
1. Announcements and events organized by the Club.
2. Educational materials that might be useful to Carpentry students or trainers.
3. Local events that might be of interest to Carpentry students or trainers.
4. Humourous content related to Carpentry courses.

### Don't promote
1. Specific political organizations or positions, unless they have been specifically endorsed by the UF Carpentries Club board.
2. Commercial products or services.
3. Disparagement of people's work (say "X is awesome!" rather than "X is better than Y").
4. Yourself (it's "we", not "I"!).

### Content guidelines
* Tag [@TheCarpentries](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries) or [@DataCarpentry](https://twitter.com/datacarpentry) when relevant.
* Photos, images, animated gifs and emoji are encouraged.
* Posts are expected to be casual, not formal. Formal posts should be written as a blog post on this website and posted to our social media platforms.
* All posts on our social media platforms must be in line with our [Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code-of-conduct/).
