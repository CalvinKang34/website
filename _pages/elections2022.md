## 2022-2023 UF Carpentries Club Board Member Elections are Open!

**Nominations are due back by midnight of September 16th.**

Are you interested in advancing informatics skills and reproducible science at UF? 
Join the UF Carpentries Club Board!

The Carpentries is an international organization that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. The UF Carpentries Club is dedicated to bringing the inclusive and supportive culture and curricula to the University of Florida, primarily through 2-day instructional workshops in R, Python, GitHub and more!

Our Board is composed of 7 representatives, who coordinate the workshop schedule, interface with our supporters, and create opportunities for peer learning at UF and beyond. As a member of the Board, you will network with data science peers from different backgrounds, be involved in the organizational aspects of the largest cross-departmental group promoting informatics literacy at UF, and help make the local Carpentries community grow and be successful.

If you would like to become more involved in lesson planning, teaching, community building, and more, please consider self-nominating for a Board position for the academic year October 2022- September 2023.

2. Previously participated in a Carpentry event in any capacity (learner, helper, instructor, organizer, host, or funder) at UF or elsewhere in the past 2 years.

* Secretary (takes meeting notes during board meetings and creates minutes file in Github to post to website after meeting)*
*   *These positions rotate every 2 meetings to a different board member and all board members share this responsibility at some time during their term.

In addition, one Board member may be designated the “Outreach Board Member.” The criteria to stand for election for the position of Outreach Board Member include:
