excerpt: "R-Ladies 2019 recap"

As 2019 draws to an end, as R-ladies organizers, we can look back on an amazing year. We have held a total of 10 meetings with a huge variety of topics. We ran an introductory R workshop in October and had more advanced workshops earlier in the year on RMarkdown (March), making packages (April), visualization (February), reproducible research with Docker (November) and working with spatial data (December). We also had more social and discussion-oriented meetings: on data and research consulting in January, citeable code in May, a book club discussion in July and a social with other organizations that focus on STEM and under-represented groups in September. Our locations were just as varied: the Alachua County Headquarters library (downtown), The Bull, Cypress & Grove Brewery, Carr Hall on UF Campus and The Hub at UF Innovate (we were hosted by Collaboratory for Women Innovators).

Our reach has grown steadily since we started in August 2018: at the moment we have 246 members in our online meetup.com group, 81 people in our mailing list and 305 followers on Twitter. The organizing team has also grown, and currently consists of Javi Rudolph, Amy Kendig, Kristen Sauby, Virnaliz Cruz and Geraldine Klarenberg.

But the amazing-ness does not stop there: in 2019 we also became one of the few R-Ladies chapters with their own logo! Thanks to our own Virnaliz, with the help of John Buenaventura, we had a number of designs to choose from. Our Twitter poll on 4 designs attracted 67 voters, and the winning design garnered 46% of the votes. We are grateful to the UF Carpentries Club for their support and funding sticker printing for us: we now have regular R-Ladies and customized Gainesville R-Ladies hex stickers to give away!
